# Ninja Gaming

Powered by Svelte & SvelteKit.

## About

This project is meant to be used as part of learning Svelte and SvelteKit. The codes in here may be adapted from other projects to avoid implementing features not related to the topics being learned.

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
